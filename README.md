# TTS Audiobook Project

# AI Audio Playground MVP

## Vision Statement
Our vision is to empower individuals with personalized audio experiences by leveraging cutting-edge AI and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies. We aim to create a platform that generates tailored audiobooks and affirmations, enhancing personal growth and self-improvement through customized content that aligns with each user's unique goals and preferences.

## Project Overview
